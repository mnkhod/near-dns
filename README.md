### Mini-DNS
---
  The idea of this project comes from [UnstoppableDomains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/). I don't think im gonna start by allowing every domain to be a NFT.
  
  Thinking of having domains that is mapped to ip4 addresses and having an Front-End where you can insert the domain and it pops up the website in the browser.

  Allowing people to have their own mini DNS on the blockchain : ))
